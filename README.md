The intent of this analysis is to help researchers more easily review test subject information for the purposes of finding a suitable bacteria to produce synthetic beef. We implemented several charts to aid researchers in visualizing data such as a bar chart for displaying the amount and type of bacteria per sample, and a gauge chart that displays the frequency that test subject washes their belly button. This dashboard will allow researchers and volunteers to easily browse through patient ID's to more easily draw conclusions using the charts we provided.
